    <h1> INTRODUCTION </h1>
    <h1> Welcome to my HTML project page! </h1>
    <br> 
    <p> HTML is the standard markup page for the creation of Web pages. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of a Web page and consists of a  
    series of elements. Overall, HTML tells the browser how to display the content on the web page. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1> ELEMENTS </h1>
    <p> HTML elements are the contents stored inside the start and end tags. Note: there are some elements that don't require end tags (like "br"), which are also known as empty
      elements. All HTML pages should be nested HTML elements, which is when elements contain other elements. For example, the "html" tag must contain "head" and "body" starting
      and ending tags inside the "html" tag. <br> Some HTML tags don't require an ending tag, but it is always recommended to include them to avoid errors and bugs. HTML is not 
      case sensitive, but it is recommended to use lowercases, at least when it comes to using tags. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1> ATTRIBUTES </h1>
    <p> HTML attributes provides additional information to HTML elements. This is available to all HTML elements and are specified in the starting tag. Examples of attributes
      are "href" (used in hyperlinks), src (used in images), "width" and "height" (used in images), "alt" (used in images"), "style" (used for CSS styling), "lang" (used to 
      declare the default language of the Web page, <i> which can be found in the source code for the "html" starting tag </i>), "title", etc. <br> HTML attributes aren't
      required to be lowercased and surrounded by double quotes, but it is recommended to do so. Single quotes are also allowed in some situations. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1> HEADINGS </h1>
    <p> Headings are used for titles ad subtitiles for an HTML webpage. They serve the puropse of organizing the structure and content of the web page. Below are the different 
      types of headings that HTML supports from "h1" tags to "h6" tags. </p>
    <h1> Heading 1 </h1>
    <h2> Heading 2 </h2>
    <h3> Heading 3 </h3>
    <h4> Heading 4 </h4>
    <h5> Heading 5 </h5>
    <h6> Heading 6 </h6>
    <br>
    <p> Even though these headings have their own default sizes, they can be changed using the CSS font-size property. Below is an example of an "h1" tag with its size changed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1 style = "font-size: 50px;"> Heading 1 with changed size </h1>
    <br>
    
    <h1> PARAGRAPHS & TEXTS </h1>
    <p> This body of text is created as a paragraph using the "p" tag. Paragraphs are used as a block of text in an HTML page. They always start on a new line and there tends to
    be some margins before and after paragraphs. Sizes of paragraphs can be resized based on the screen size of the user. <br> The "hr" tag is used to create a horizontal break
    in an HTML page to seperate content. The "br" tag defines a line break for content to start on a new line. Both tags are empty HTML elements. <i> See them in use in the HTML
    source code. </i> <br> The "pre" tag organizes HTML text in a preformatted way, which can be used if the user wishes to create texts in the format of a poem. Below is an 
    example of such. </p>
    <br>
    <pre> 
    Roses are red
    Violets are blue
    You've learned something new on this HTML page.
    Haven't you?
    </pre>
    <br>
    
    <h1> STYLES </h1>
    <p> The HTML "style" attribute is used to add CSS styles to an element. This can include color, font, size, text-alignment, etc. <i> See it in use through the HTML source
      code. </i> Examples of the style attribute are shown below: </p>
    <br>
    <p style = "background-color:blue;"> This paragraph has its background color changed using the "background-color" attribute. </p>
    <p style = "color:red;"> This paragraph has its text color changed using the "color" attribute. </p>
    <p style = "font-family:courier;"> This paragraph has its font changed using the "font-family" attribute. </p>
    <p style = "font-size:200%;"> This paragraph has its font size changed using the "font-size" attribute. </p>
    <p style - "text-align:center;"> This paragraph has its text alignment changed using the "text-align" attribute. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1> FORMATTING </h1>
    <p> HTML can format several elements in order to define texts with a special meaning. Below are examples of different ways to format HTML text: </p>
    <br>
    <p> <b> This text is bolded using the "b" tag. </b> </p>
    <p> <strong> This text is strongly important using the "strong" tag. </strong> </p>
    <p> <i> This text is italic using the "i" tag. </i> </p>
    <p> <em> This text is emphasized using the "em" tag. </em> </p>
    <p> <mark> This text is marked using the "mark" tag. </mark> </p>
    <p> <small> This text is smaller using the "small" tag. </small> </p>
    <p> This text <del> is </del> deleted using the "del" tag. </p>
    <p> This text has been inserted with a color: <ins> black </ins> using the "ins" tag. </p>
    <p> <sub> This text has been subscripted using the "sub" tag. </sub> </p>
    <p> <sup> This text has been superscripted using the "sup" tag. </sup> <p>
    <br>
    <p> <i> See formatted tags in HTML source code </i> </p>
    
    <h1> QUOTATIONS </h1>
    <p> HTML pages can quote from other websites using different HTML quoting tags like "blockquote", "q", "abbr", "address", "cite", and "bdo". </p> <br>
    <p> The "blockquote" tag defines a section that is quoted from another source and are usually indented. Below is an example of such: </p>
    <blockquote cite = "https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/03/01/funimation-content-moving-to-crunchyroll-for-worlds-largest-anime-library"> 
    Huge news: Anime just powered up! Funimation, which serves millions of anime fans in over 52 countries and 10 languages, will be unifying under the Crunchyroll brand. This 
    move will include Funimation’s subsidiary, Wakanim, as well as Crunchyroll’s VRV to create one subscription service for our anime fans worldwide.
    </blockquote> <br>
    <p> The "q" tag defines a quotation by inserting quotation marks where the tags appear. Below is an example of such: (each anime has its own quotation marks) </p>
    <p> That includes titles available now like <q> My Hero Academia </q>, <q> Tokyo Ghoul </q> and <q> Yu Yu Hakusho </q> alongside favorites like <q> Cowboy Bebop </q> and 
    <q> Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation </q>, all under one subscription! </p> <br>
    <p> The "abbr" tag defines abbreviations. (Including the title attribute allows the user to view the full meaning when the mouse hovers over the abbreviation.) Below is an 
    example of such: </p> 
    <p> My favorite anime from Crunchyroll is <abbr title = "One Piece"> OP </abbr>. </p> <br>
    <p> The "address" tag defines the contact information for an author/owner of an article/document. This can include email addresses, URLs, home addresses, phone numbers, 
      social media accounts, etc. <i> *See at the "More About Me" section at the bottom of the HTML page for example* </i> </p> <br>
    <p> The "cite" tag defines the title of a creative work in italic format. Below is an example of such: </p> 
    <p> <cite> One Piece </cite> by Eiichiro Oda. </p> <br>
    <p> The "bdo" tag stands for Bi-Directional Override. It overrides the text direction. Below is an example of such: </p> 
    <bdo dir = "rtl"> One Piece </bdo> <br>

    <h1> CSS </h1>
    <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to format the layout of the HTML webpage. It has 3 ways of being added into HTML pages. This is inline CSS, Internal 
      CSS, and External CSS. </p> <br>
    <p> Inline CSS applies a CSS style to a single HTML element by using the style attribute on an HTML element as shown below <i> in HTML source code </i>. </p>
    <p style = "color: green;"> Inline CSS </p> <br>
    <p> Internal CSS applies a CSS style for the HTML page by defining a style element in the "head" section of the HTML page. <i> See "head" section of HTML source code for 
      example where the background color of the HTML page is changed. </i> </p> <br>
    <p> External CSS can define the CSS styles for multiple HTML pags by creating an external file <i> which can be found in the designated CSS file in this GitHub Repository.
      External sheets can be referenced through a file name, a full URL, or a relative path. </i> To view the external style sheet reference, <i> see HTML source code in "head" 
      section. </i> </p>
    
    <h1> LINKS </h1>
    <p> HTML allows users to click and jump to different webpages by using hyperlinks. HTML links uses the "a" tag and must have the "href" attribute since it's the link's 
      destination. The content between the "a" starting and ending tags will be the link shown as text that is displayed to the user. It will still function as a hyperlink and 
      send the user to the new URL when clicked. Below is an example: </p> <br>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com"> Click to go to Google </a>
    <br>
    <p> HTML hyperlinks have another important attribute known as the "target" attribute. By default, the "target" attribute will have the "_self" value. However, the user can 
      freely choose from the following values: "_self", "_blank", "_parent", and "_top". </p> <br>
    <p> The "_self" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in the same window/tab. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_self"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> The "_blank" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in a new window/tab. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_blank"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> The "_parent" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in the parent frame. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_parent"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> The "_top" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in a full body of the window. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_top"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> HTML links can be specified through an Absolute URL or a Relative URL as shown below <i> in the HTML source code </i>. </p> <br>
    <p> Absolute URL: <a href = "https://www.google.com"> Click to go to Google </a> </p>
    <p> Relative URL: <a href = "google.com"> Click to go to Google </a> </p> <br>
    <p> HTML Links can also be displayed as images while having the full capabilities of hyperlinks by putting the "img" tag in the content section of the "a" tag. </p>
    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target = "_blank">
      <img src = "https://media.musclegrid.io/thekarateedge.com/uploads/2017/05/13234502/click-here-to-enroll.png" width = "300" height = "300">
    </a>
    <br>
    <p> HTML buttons can also be used to access different hyperlinks as shown below. </p>
    <button onclick = "document.location='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'"> Rick Roll Button </button>
    <br>
    <p> Using the title attribute, HTML links can display extra information as a tooltip which is shown when the mouse hovers over the title of the link. </p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" title = "Click to search on Google"> Google </a> <br>
     <!-- Link colors -->
      
    <img src = "https://wallpaper.dog/large/20345592.jpg" alt = "One Piece image" width = "700" height = "700"> </img>
