    <h1 id = "introduction"> INTRODUCTION </h1>
    <br> 
    <p> HTML is the standard markup page for the creation of Web pages. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of a Web page and 
      consists of a series of elements. Overall, HTML tells the browser how to display the content on the web page. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1 id = "element"> ELEMENTS </h1>
    <p> HTML elements are the contents stored inside the start and end tags. Note: there are some elements that don't require end tags (like "br"), which are also 
      known as empty elements. All HTML pages should be nested HTML elements, which is when elements contain other elements. For example, the "html" tag must contain 
      "head" and "body" starting and ending tags inside the "html" tag. <br> Some HTML tags don't require an ending tag, but it is always recommended to include them 
      to avoid errors and bugs. HTML is not case sensitive, but it is recommended to use lowercases, at least when it comes to using tags. </p>
    <p> For the list of available HTML tags, visit <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp" target = "_blank"> HTML Tags </a>. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1 id = "attribute"> ATTRIBUTES </h1>
    <p> HTML attributes provides additional information to HTML elements. This is available to all HTML elements and are specified in the starting tag. Examples of 
      attributes are "href" (used in hyperlinks), src (used in images), "width" and "height" (used in images), "alt" (used in images"), "style" (used for CSS styling), 
      "lang" (used to declare the default language of the Web page, <i> which can be found in the source code for the "html" starting tag </i>), "title", etc. <br> 
      HTML attributes aren't required to be lowercased and surrounded by double quotes, but it is recommended to do so. Single quotes are also allowed in some 
      situations. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1 id = "heading"> HEADINGS </h1>
    <p> Headings are used for titles ad subtitiles for an HTML webpage. They serve the puropse of organizing the structure and content of the web page. Below are the 
      different types of headings that HTML supports from "h1" tags to "h6" tags. </p>
    <h1> Heading 1 </h1>
    <h2> Heading 2 </h2>
    <h3> Heading 3 </h3>
    <h4> Heading 4 </h4>
    <h5> Heading 5 </h5>
    <h6> Heading 6 </h6>
    <br>
    <p> Even though these headings have their own default sizes, they can be changed using the CSS font-size property. Below is an example of an "h1" tag with its size
     changed. </p>
    <br>
    <h1 style = "font-size: 50px;"> Heading 1 with changed size </h1>
    <br>
    
    <h1 id = "paragraph"> PARAGRAPHS & TEXTS </h1>
    <p> This body of text is created as a paragraph using the "p" tag. Paragraphs are used as a block of text in an HTML page. They always start on a new line and 
      there tends to be some margins before and after paragraphs. Sizes of paragraphs can be resized based on the screen size of the user. <br> The "hr" tag is used to
      create a horizontal break in an HTML page to seperate content. The "br" tag defines a line break for content to start on a new line. Both tags are empty HTML 
      elements. <i> See them in use in the HTML source code. </i> <br> The "pre" tag organizes HTML text in a preformatted way, which can be used if the user wishes to
      create texts in the format of a poem. Below is an example of such. </p>
    <br>
    <pre> 
    Roses are red
    Violets are blue
    You've learned something new on this HTML page.
    Haven't you?
    </pre>
    <br>
    
    <h1 id = "style"> STYLES </h1>
    <p> The HTML "style" attribute is used to add CSS styles to an element. This can include color, font, size, text-alignment, etc. <i> See it in use through the HTML
      source code. </i> Examples of the style attribute are shown below: </p>
    <br>
    <p style = "background-color:blue;"> This paragraph has its background color changed using the "background-color" attribute. </p>
    <p style = "color:red;"> This paragraph has its text color changed using the "color" attribute. </p>
    <p style = "font-family:courier;"> This paragraph has its font changed using the "font-family" attribute. </p>
    <p style = "font-size:200%;"> This paragraph has its font size changed using the "font-size" attribute. </p>
    <p style - "text-align:center;"> This paragraph has its text alignment changed using the "text-align" attribute. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1 id = "format"> FORMATTING </h1>
    <p> HTML can format several elements in order to define texts with a special meaning. Below are examples of different ways to format HTML text: </p>
    <br>
    <p> <b> This text is bolded using the "b" tag. </b> </p>
    <p> <strong> This text is strongly important using the "strong" tag. </strong> </p>
    <p> <i> This text is italic using the "i" tag. </i> </p>
    <p> <em> This text is emphasized using the "em" tag. </em> </p>
    <p> <mark> This text is marked using the "mark" tag. </mark> </p>
    <p> <small> This text is smaller using the "small" tag. </small> </p>
    <p> This text <del> is </del> deleted using the "del" tag. </p>
    <p> This text has been inserted with a color: <ins> black </ins> using the "ins" tag. </p>
    <p> <sub> This text has been subscripted using the "sub" tag. </sub> </p>
    <p> <sup> This text has been superscripted using the "sup" tag. </sup> <p>
    <br>
    <p> <i> See formatted tags in HTML source code </i> </p>
    
    <h1 id = "quotation"> QUOTATIONS </h1>
    <p> HTML pages can quote from other websites using different HTML quoting tags like "blockquote", "q", "abbr", "address", "cite", and "bdo". </p> <br>
    <p> The "blockquote" tag defines a section that is quoted from another source and are usually indented. Below is an example of such: </p>
    <blockquote cite = "https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/03/01/funimation-content-moving-to-crunchyroll-for-worlds-largest-anime-library"> 
    Huge news: Anime just powered up! Funimation, which serves millions of anime fans in over 52 countries and 10 languages, will be unifying under the Crunchyroll 
      brand. This move will include Funimation’s subsidiary, Wakanim, as well as Crunchyroll’s VRV to create one subscription service for our anime fans worldwide.
    </blockquote> <br>
    <p> The "q" tag defines a quotation by inserting quotation marks where the tags appear. Below is an example of such: (each anime has its own quotation marks) </p>
    <p> That includes titles available now like <q> My Hero Academia </q>, <q> Tokyo Ghoul </q> and <q> Yu Yu Hakusho </q> alongside favorites like <q> Cowboy Bebop 
    </q> and <q> Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation </q>, all under one subscription! </p> <br>
    <p> The "abbr" tag defines abbreviations. (Including the title attribute allows the user to view the full meaning when the mouse hovers over the abbreviation.) 
      Below is an example of such: </p> 
    <p> My favorite anime from Crunchyroll is <abbr title = "One Piece"> OP </abbr>. </p> <br>
    <p> The "address" tag defines the contact information for an author/owner of an article/document. This can include email addresses, URLs, home addresses, phone 
      numbers, social media accounts, etc. <i> *See at the "More About Me" section at the bottom of the HTML page for example* </i> </p> <br>
    <p> The "cite" tag defines the title of a creative work in italic format. Below is an example of such: </p> 
    <p> <cite> One Piece </cite> by Eiichiro Oda. </p> <br>
    <p> The "bdo" tag stands for Bi-Directional Override. It overrides the text direction. Below is an example of such: </p> 
    <bdo dir = "rtl"> One Piece </bdo> <br>
    
    <h1 id = "comment"> COMMENTS </h1>
    <p> See in HTML source code </p> <br>
    <!-- This is a comment. -->
    
    <h1 id = "color"> COLORS </h1>
    <p> WIP - See in https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp </p> <br>
    
    <h1 id = "css"> CSS </h1>
    <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to format the layout of the HTML webpage. It has 3 ways of being added into HTML pages. This is inline CSS, 
      Internal CSS, and External CSS. </p> <br>
    <p> Inline CSS applies a CSS style to a single HTML element by using the style attribute on an HTML element as shown below <i> in HTML source code </i>. </p>
    <p style = "color: green;"> Inline CSS </p> <br>
    <p> Internal CSS applies a CSS style for the HTML page by defining a style element in the "head" section of the HTML page. <i> See "head" section of HTML source 
      code for example where the background of the HTML page is changed. </i> </p> <br>
    <p> External CSS can define the CSS styles for multiple HTML pags by creating an external file <i> which can be found in the designated CSS file in this GitHub 
      Repository. External sheets can be referenced through a file name, a full URL, or a relative path. </i> To view the external style sheet reference, <i> see HTML 
      source code in "head" section. </i> <br> <i> See the CSS external file in the source code for more on CSS styling. </i> </p>
    
    <h1 id = "link"> LINKS </h1>
    <p> HTML allows users to click and jump to different webpages by using hyperlinks. HTML links uses the "a" tag and must have the "href" attribute since it's the 
      link's destination. The content between the "a" starting and ending tags will be the link shown as text that is displayed to the user. It will still function as 
      a hyperlink and send the user to the new URL when clicked. Below is an example: </p> <br>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com"> Click to go to Google </a>
    <br>
    <p> HTML hyperlinks have another important attribute known as the "target" attribute. By default, the "target" attribute will have the "_self" value. However, the 
      user can freely choose from the following values: "_self", "_blank", "_parent", and "_top". </p> <br>
    <p> The "_self" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in the same window/tab. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_self"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> The "_blank" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in a new window/tab. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_blank"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> The "_parent" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in the parent frame. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_parent"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> The "_top" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in a full body of the window. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_top"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> HTML links can be specified through an Absolute URL or a Relative URL as shown below <i> in the HTML source code </i>. </p> <br>
    <p> Absolute URL: <a href = "https://www.google.com"> Click to go to Google </a> </p>
    <p> Relative URL: <a href = "google.com"> Click to go to Google </a> </p> <br>
    <p> HTML Links can also be displayed as images while having the full capabilities of hyperlinks by putting the "img" tag in the content section of the "a" tag.</p>
    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target = "_blank">
      <img src = "https://media.musclegrid.io/thekarateedge.com/uploads/2017/05/13234502/click-here-to-enroll.png" width = "300" height = "300">
    </a>
    <br>
    <p> HTML buttons can also be used to access different hyperlinks as shown below. </p>
    <button onclick = "document.location='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'"> Rick Roll Button </button>
    <br>
    <p> Using the title attribute, HTML links can display extra information as a tooltip which is shown when the mouse hovers over the title of the link. </p>
    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" title = "Click to search on Google" target = "_blank"> Google </a> <br>
     <!-- Link colors -->
      
    <h1 id = "image"> IMAGES </h1>
    <img src = "https://wallpaper.dog/large/20345592.jpg" alt = "One Piece image" width = "700" height = "700"> </img> <!-- TO be continued -->
  <br>
  
  <h1 id = "favicon"> FAVICONS </h1>
  <p> A favicon is the small image displayed next to the webpage title in the browser tab. The user can pick their desired favicon as if it was an image. The image can
    be from a file on the user's computer or an image from the Internet. <i> To see how the favicon is implemented into the site, view the HTML source code under the 
    head section below the title line. </i> </p>
    
  <h1 id = "table"> TABLES </h1> 
  <p> HTML tables arranges datas into rows and columns. </p> <!-- To be continued -->
  
  <h1 id = "list"> LISTS </h1> 
  <p> HTML lists groups a set of items or data into ordered and/or unordered lists. </p> <!-- To be continued. -->
  
  <h1 id = "block/inline"> BLOCK AND INLINE </h1>
  <p> Every HTML element has a display value. However, in HTML, there are two types of display values. These two types are block and inline. <br> Block-level elements 
    are elements that alawys start on new lines along with the browser adding a margin before and after the element. Block-level elements typically takes up the full 
    width of the display. The most commonly used block elements are the "p" and "div" tags. Other block elements are the "address", "article", "aside", "blockquote", 
    "canvas", "dd", "div", "dl", "dt", "fieldset", "figcaption", "figure", "footer", "form", "h1-h6", "header", "hr", "li", "main", "nav", "noscript", "ol", "p", 
    "pre", "section", "table", "tfoot", "ul", and "video" tags. <br> Inline elements are elements that doesn't start on a new line. Unlike block elements, inline 
    elements will only take as much width as it needs. Inline elements in HTML are the "a", "abbr", "acronym", "b", "bdo", "big", "br", "button", "cite", "code", 
    "dfn", "em", "i", "img", "input", "kbd", "label", "map", "object", "output", "q", "samp", "script", "select", "small", "span", "strong", "sub", "sup", "textarea", 
    "time", "tt", and "var" tags. <br> The "div" element is used in HTML as a container to divide different HTML elements. Attributes aren't required, although, its 
    most common attributes are "id", "class", and "style". Below is an example of the "style" attribute used on a "div" element. </p> <br> 
    <div style = "background-color: red; color: gold;">
      <h4> I am Iron Man! </h4>
  </div> <br>
  <p> The "span" element is an inline element used to mark up part of a text/document. Similarly to the "div" element, "span" uses the common attributes "id", "class" 
    and "style" attributes although they are not required. Below is an example of the "style" attribute used on a "span" element. </p> <br>
  <p> My favorite <span style = "background-color: red; color: blue;"> Spider Man </span> is Tobey Maguire. </p>
  <br>
  
  <h1 id = "class"> CLASSES </h1>
  <p> The HTML "class" attribute specifies a class for an HTML element. With the "class" attribute, multiple HTML elements can share the same class. This can also be 
    used in CSS stylesheets and Javascript scripts to access and manipulate elements within the class. To create a class, the syntax starts with a period (.) followed 
    by the class name and curly braces where in between is the properties for the class. The user can have multiple classes for each HTML element and different 
    elements can even share the same class. Note: the class name is case sensitive. In this example, the class will be declared in the head section (found in the HTML 
    source code) and below, the class will be called with the div and span elements below and if done correctly, the example paragraphs will be in the Times New Roman 
    font with a white text color. </p> <br>
    
    <div class = "main">
      <p> Hello World! </p>
  </div>
  <p> Hello <span class = "main"> Beautiful </span> World! </p>
  <br>
  
  <h1 id = "id"> IDS </h1>
  <p> The HTML "id" attribute allows the user to specify a unique id for HTML elements. Multiple elements can't have the same id unlike HTML classes. The value of the 
    id attribute must be unique within the HTML page. Just like HTML classes, the "id" attribute can be used in CSS stylesheets and Javascript scripts and the syntax 
    are the same, but instead the "id" attribute uses a hashtag character (#) instead of the period character that the classes use when declaring them. "Ids" are also 
    case sensitive and must have at least one character, can't have spaces, and can't start with a number. In this example, the id will be declared in the head section
    (HTML source code) and below, the heading will have its font changed to the copperplate font. </p> <br>
    
  <h3 id = "uni"> Hello World! </h3>
  <br>
  
  <p> Thanks to the "id" attribute, they can serve as bookmarks which can be used to jump from one section of the webpage to another section. This is done by creating 
    an id and then adding a link to the id. When the link is clicked, the page will automatically scroll to the bookmarked link. </p>
  <!-- Create sections at top of page where user can use to scroll to different parts of HTML page; use this example to put user back to top of page. -->
  
  <h1 id = "iframe"> IFRAMES </h1>
  <p> An HTML IFRAME is a web page displayed in a web page. This is done by using the "iframe" tag to specify an inline frame. The inline frame allows the HTML page to
    embed another document with the HTML document. Below is the iframe displaying one of my go to anime websites. <br> </p>
    
  <iframe src = "https://www2.kickassanime.ro/" title = "Anime Streaming Site" height = "400" width = "600"> </iframe>
  
  <p> It is encouraged to add a title attribute to the iframe syntax so the user can read what the content of Iframe is about. The height and width attribute may also 
    be used to specify the size of the frame in pixels. The style attribute can also be used to adjust the height and width properties through the CSS format. Below is
    another example of the anime streaming website, but if you look closely, the border in the Iframe is no longer there. <br> </p>
  
  <iframe src = "https://www2.kickassanime.ro/" title = "Anime Streaming Site 2" style = "height:400px;width:600px;border:none;"> </iframe>
  
  <p> There is a border that surrounds the Iframe by default, but it can be removed or changed by using the style attribute using the CSS border property. Below is the
  same Example 2, but this time, it will have a yellow border surrounding the Iframe. </p>
  
  <iframe src = "https://www2.kickassanime.ro/" title = "Anime Streaming Site 2" style = "height:400px;width:600px;border:2px solid yellow;"> </iframe>
  
  <p> Lastly, the target attribute of the url in the Iframe can be used as a target frame for a link. Below is an example of this situation. The iframe will start on 
    the anime website, but once the link below is clicked, it will open the episode list of One Piece. </p> <br>
  
  <iframe src = "https://www2.kickassanime.ro/" name = "switch" title = "Anime Website" height = "500" width = "700"> </iframe> <br>
  <a href = "https://www2.kickassanime.ro/anime/one-piece-779470" target = "switch"> One Piece </a>
  
  <h1 id = "javascript"> JAVASCRIPT </h1>
  <p> This will be a simple introduction of JavaScript. To learn more about Javascript, a Javascript file will be created and asscessible for the user to view at a
    later time. <i> Javascript scripts will be located at the bottom of the HTML source code below the body section. </i> This first example is a button and when 
  clicked, it will display the time and date. </p>  
  <button type = "button" onclick = "document.getElementById('js').innerHTML = Date()"> Click for the current Date and Time </button>
  <p id = "js"> </p>
  <p> The HTML "script" tag is used to implement a client-side Javascript. The "script" element can contain script tags within the HTML code, or it can be linked
    through an external Javascript file. Javascript is commonly used for dynamic changes in content and form validation. The most common method users will use from 
    Javascript to use on their HTML page would be the "document.getElementByID" command. Javascript can go so far to change CSS styles and HTML attributes. The HTML
    "noscript" tag allows the user to define an alternate amount of content that will be displayed to users if the browser ever encounters scripts that are not 
    supported or disabled. <i> See the head section for the script tags that were used in this HTML page. </i>
  
  <h1 id = "filepath"> FILE PATHS </h1>
  <p> An HTML file path is used to describe the location of a file in the website's folder structure. They are typically used when the user wants to link an extenal
    file which includes Web pages, Images, Stylesheets, and Javascripts. <br> Absolute file paths provides the full URL to a file. Below is an example of an image
    being implemented using an absolute path. </p>

<p> A relative file path points out the file relative to the current page. Relative paths are the best paths to practice. When using relative paths, the web pages
  won't be bound to the current base URL. 

  <h1 id = "head"> HEAD </h1>
  <p> The HTML "head" element contains the meta information of the HTML page. It is a container for the "title", "style", "meta", "link", "script", and the "base"
    element. The "head" element is located in the HTML code between the "html" tag and the "body" tag. The information inside the "head" tags will not be displayed in
    the HTML page. The "head" section is responsible for defining the document's title, character set, styles, scripts, and/or any other meta information that the user
    wishes to use in his/her page. <br> The "title" element allows the user to define the title of the HTML document. The title must be text only. It will be displayed
    in the browser's title bar or the page's tab. The title is a required element for HTML. The page title is important for Search Engine Optimization (SEOs) since
    the title is used to decide the order when listing pages in search results. Overall, the "title" element defines a title for the browser's toolbar, provides a
    title for the page (in case the user stores the HTML site in the Favorites folder), and it displays a title for the page in search engines. <br> The "style" 
    element is used to define internal CSS styling information for the HTML page. <br> The "link" element links external files into the current HTML file through the 
    "link" tag. <br> The HTML "meta" element is used to specify the character sets, page descriptions, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. It 
    will not be displayed on the pages, but the "meta" will be used by browsers (to display and reload content), search engines (particularly keywords), and other 
    web services if necessary. <br> The viewports is the region of area where the user can view on their device. Viewports can vary, based on the user's device 
    whether it's a computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc. The "viewports" attriubte allows the browser to receive instructions on how the web page should be scaled 
    and lays out the dimensions. The "width=device-width" sets the width for the page in order to follow the built in screen width of the user's device. The "initial-
    scale=1.0" sets the zoom level when the page loads into the browser. <br> The HTML "script" element implements client-side Javascripts.

    <i> See Javascript section to learn more about Javascript in HTML. <br> The HTML "base" element specifies the base URL and targets all relative URLs in an HTML 
      page. The "base" tag can include a "href" and/or a "target" attribute. However, it's important to note that there can only be one "base" element in an HTML page.

<p> It's essential to have clean and organized HTML code to make it easy to read and understand. This section goes over many different ways to keep HTML code neat. 
  Firstly, use lowercase element names since mixing uppercase and lowercase is confusing, developers normally use lowercase, it looks cleaner, and it's easier to use.
  Always declare the document type in the first line of the document and its corresponding tags below. Make sure to close all HTML elements, even if it may work
  without ending tags. Also, use lowercase attribute names and quote attribute values since developers do it, it makes the value easier to read, and it won't take the
  value if there is a space in between. Always specify height, width, and alt for images to reduce flickering and creates alternate text if the image can't load into
  the page. HTML allows spaces around equal signs but no spaces is easier to read and groups entities better. Avoid using long code lines so the user doesn't have to 
  scroll left and right to view the code. Don't add blank lines, spaces, or indentations for no reason. Adding blank lines is useful however for seperating large code
  blocks and two spaces of indentation is good enough for seperating entities. Never skip the title element because it is a requirement for HTML since SEOs use the 
  page title using search engine algorithms to order pages in search results. HTML and body tags are strongly recommended to be added, even if the page will still work
  since it can cause errors for old browsers and can possibly crash the DOM and XML software. The same goes for the head tag, but there will be no consequences if the 
  head tag isn't included since the browser will automatically create a head section for code before the body. It is optional to close empty elements, but it's still
  recommended to close them in the chance of using XML or XHTML. You should always include the lang attribute to declare the official language of the HTML page to 
  assist search engines and browsers. For proper interpretation and search engine indexing, the charset should be defined as early as possible in the HTML code. The 
  viewport should be included since it sets the user's visible area of the page whether it's a small screen like a phone or big as a monitor or TV using the meta tag. 
  Comments should be included when necessary to explain certain parts of the code for viewers to understand and it's recommended to use two spaces of indentation for 
  comments. Use simple syntax when referencing external style sheets. For CSS styling in HTML pages, short CSS code can be compressed into one line but for long CSS 
  code, write them using multiple lines with the styling code in between the brackets having two spaces of indentation. The same goes for Javascripts, with its own 
  additional styling found in the Javascript portion of the HTMLEx program. Use lowercase file names since some web servers are case sensitive. HTML files should have
  an .html extension, CSS files should have a .css extension, and Javascript files should have a .js extension. Lastly, when a URL doesn't have a specified name, the 
  server creates a default filename and it's important to keep note of the filename that is used for your HTML project. </p>
  
  <h1 id = "entity"> ENTITIES </h1>
<p> HTML reserved characters must be replaced with character entities. For example, the user may not be able to use the less than or greater than symbols since the 
  browser may mistake them for the starting or ending tag. Therefore, character entities are used to display HTML reserved characters in HTML pages. To display a less
  than symbol, it will be displayed as &lt; or &#60; <i> see source code </i>. The advantage of using an entity name is that it's easy to remember while the 
  disadvantage is that browsers may not support all entity names since they mostly support entity numbers. A common entity in HTML is the non-breaking space (&nbsp);,
  which is a space that doesn't break into a new line. This is useful when the user doesn't want to break any words as well as it prevents browsers from spacing in
  HTML pages. It's important to note that entity names are case sensitive. <br> Diacritical marks are "glyphs" added to a letter. They can appear ablove or below a 
  letter, inside, and/or in between two letters. Diacritical marks can be used with alphanumeric characters to produce characters that aren't typically in the 
  character set. An example of this is a&#768;. </p>
  
  <h1 id = "symbol"> SYMBOLS </h1>
<p> HTML symbols not present on the keyboard can be added using entities. For example, many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols aren't on a typical computer
  keyboard. However, they can be added to an HTML page using the entity name or number as well as the corresponding syntax for the symbol. </p>

  <h1 id = "emoji"> EMOJIS </h1>
<p> HTML emojis can be used from the UTF-8 charset. Emojis may look like images or icons, but they are actually inputted as letters and characters in the UTF-8 
  charset. (UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world). A web browser must know the character set used in the page in order to display an HTML
  page correctly. This is why we include the "meta" tag <i> (see meta tag in head section of HTML source code) </i>. Although, if not specified, UTF-8 is the default 
  charset in HTML. However, many UTF-8 characters can't be typed on keyboards (like emojis), so we will have to use numbers to display them. For example, A is 65, B
  is 66, C is 67, and vice versa. The syntax for displaying characters using numbers is "&#number;". For example, to get the emoji with the heart eyes, it will be 
  displayed as &#128525;. Emojis are characters, therefore, they can be copied, displayed, and sized like any other HTML character. </p>

<p style = "font-size:60px"> &#128513; &#128513; &#128513; </p>

<p> The following link is a list of emojis that HTML can support as well as its corresponding number codes. </p>
<a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp" target = "_blank"> HTML Emojis </a>
  
  <h1 id = "charset"> CHARSET </h1>
<p> A web browser must first know which cahracter set to use in order to display an HTML page correctly. This is why we use the "meta" tag in the head section to tell
  the browser which charset to use. The default character set for HTML5 is UTF-8. UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for values 0 to 127 and doesn't use values 128 to 159. 
  UTF-8 is identical to the ANSI and 8859-1 character set for values 160 to 255. UTF-8 continues from value 256 to 10,000+ different characters. For the complete HTML
  character set, follow the link <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/default.asp" target = "_blank"> HTML Charset </a> </p>
  
  <h1 id = "url"> URL ENCODE </h1>
<p> Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are web addresses composed of words or Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Web browsers request pages from web servers using a URL.
  URLs addresses documents on the web. The format of a URL is <i> scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename </i>. <i> Scheme </i> defines the type of Internet service
  used (most commmonly http or https). <i> Prefix </i> defines the domain prefix (most commonly www.). <i> Domain </i> defines the Internet domain name. <i> Port </i>
  defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80). <i> Path </i> defines the path or root directory for the server. <i> Filename </i> defines the name
  of a document/resource. Common URL schemes include http (used for common web pages unencrypted), https (used for secure web pages encrypted), ftp (downloading/
  uploading files), and file (file on your computer). URLs are sent over the Internet only using the ASCII characters. Otherwise, the URL will have to be converted.
  URL encoding converts non ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet by replacing non ASCII characters with a "%" followed with 
  hexadecimal digits. URLs also can't contain spaces and encoding would replace a space character with a "+" or "%20". For HTML5, the default charset is UTF-8.

  <h1 id = "xhtml"> XHTML </h1>
<p> XHTML is the stricter XML based version of HTML. XTHML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language and it defines HTML as an XML application. XHTML is 
  available for all major browsers. In XHTML, all documents must be marked up correctly or be "well-formed". XHTML was designed to make HTML more extensible and 
  flexible to work with other data formats like XML. Browsers tend to ignore errors in HMTL pages and therefore displays the website despite errors, but in XHTML, it
  is much more stricter with error handling. The most important differences between XHTML and HTML when it comes to technical coding is that in XHTML, <i> the DOCTYPE
  tag is mandatory, the "xmlns" attribute in the HTML tag is mandatory, the html, head, title, and body tags are mandatory, elements must be properly nested, elements 
  must always be closed, elements and attributes must always be lowercased, attribute values must always be quoted, and attribute minimization is forbidden.
