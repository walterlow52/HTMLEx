    <h1> INTRODUCTION </h1>
    <h1> Welcome to my HTML project page! </h1>
    <br> 
    <p> HTML is the standard markup page for the creation of Web pages. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of a Web page and 
      consists of a series of elements. Overall, HTML tells the browser how to display the content on the web page. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1> ELEMENTS </h1>
    <p> HTML elements are the contents stored inside the start and end tags. Note: there are some elements that don't require end tags (like "br"), which are also 
      known as empty elements. All HTML pages should be nested HTML elements, which is when elements contain other elements. For example, the "html" tag must contain 
      "head" and "body" starting and ending tags inside the "html" tag. <br> Some HTML tags don't require an ending tag, but it is always recommended to include them 
      to avoid errors and bugs. HTML is not case sensitive, but it is recommended to use lowercases, at least when it comes to using tags. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1> ATTRIBUTES </h1>
    <p> HTML attributes provides additional information to HTML elements. This is available to all HTML elements and are specified in the starting tag. Examples of 
      attributes are "href" (used in hyperlinks), src (used in images), "width" and "height" (used in images), "alt" (used in images"), "style" (used for CSS styling), 
      "lang" (used to declare the default language of the Web page, <i> which can be found in the source code for the "html" starting tag </i>), "title", etc. <br> 
      HTML attributes aren't required to be lowercased and surrounded by double quotes, but it is recommended to do so. Single quotes are also allowed in some 
      situations. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1> HEADINGS </h1>
    <p> Headings are used for titles ad subtitiles for an HTML webpage. They serve the puropse of organizing the structure and content of the web page. Below are the 
      different types of headings that HTML supports from "h1" tags to "h6" tags. </p>
    <h1> Heading 1 </h1>
    <h2> Heading 2 </h2>
    <h3> Heading 3 </h3>
    <h4> Heading 4 </h4>
    <h5> Heading 5 </h5>
    <h6> Heading 6 </h6>
    <br>
    <p> Even though these headings have their own default sizes, they can be changed using the CSS font-size property. Below is an example of an "h1" tag with its size
     changed. </p>
    <br>
    <h1 style = "font-size: 50px;"> Heading 1 with changed size </h1>
    <br>
    
    <h1> PARAGRAPHS & TEXTS </h1>
    <p> This body of text is created as a paragraph using the "p" tag. Paragraphs are used as a block of text in an HTML page. They always start on a new line and 
      there tends to be some margins before and after paragraphs. Sizes of paragraphs can be resized based on the screen size of the user. <br> The "hr" tag is used to
      create a horizontal break in an HTML page to seperate content. The "br" tag defines a line break for content to start on a new line. Both tags are empty HTML 
      elements. <i> See them in use in the HTML source code. </i> <br> The "pre" tag organizes HTML text in a preformatted way, which can be used if the user wishes to
      create texts in the format of a poem. Below is an example of such. </p>
    <br>
    <pre> 
    Roses are red
    Violets are blue
    You've learned something new on this HTML page.
    Haven't you?
    </pre>
    <br>
    
    <h1> STYLES </h1>
    <p> The HTML "style" attribute is used to add CSS styles to an element. This can include color, font, size, text-alignment, etc. <i> See it in use through the HTML
      source code. </i> Examples of the style attribute are shown below: </p>
    <br>
    <p style = "background-color:blue;"> This paragraph has its background color changed using the "background-color" attribute. </p>
    <p style = "color:red;"> This paragraph has its text color changed using the "color" attribute. </p>
    <p style = "font-family:courier;"> This paragraph has its font changed using the "font-family" attribute. </p>
    <p style = "font-size:200%;"> This paragraph has its font size changed using the "font-size" attribute. </p>
    <p style - "text-align:center;"> This paragraph has its text alignment changed using the "text-align" attribute. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1> FORMATTING </h1>
    <p> HTML can format several elements in order to define texts with a special meaning. Below are examples of different ways to format HTML text: </p>
    <br>
    <p> <b> This text is bolded using the "b" tag. </b> </p>
    <p> <strong> This text is strongly important using the "strong" tag. </strong> </p>
    <p> <i> This text is italic using the "i" tag. </i> </p>
    <p> <em> This text is emphasized using the "em" tag. </em> </p>
    <p> <mark> This text is marked using the "mark" tag. </mark> </p>
    <p> <small> This text is smaller using the "small" tag. </small> </p>
    <p> This text <del> is </del> deleted using the "del" tag. </p>
    <p> This text has been inserted with a color: <ins> black </ins> using the "ins" tag. </p>
    <p> <sub> This text has been subscripted using the "sub" tag. </sub> </p>
    <p> <sup> This text has been superscripted using the "sup" tag. </sup> <p>
    <br>
    <p> <i> See formatted tags in HTML source code </i> </p>
    
    <h1> QUOTATIONS </h1>
    <p> HTML pages can quote from other websites using different HTML quoting tags like "blockquote", "q", "abbr", "address", "cite", and "bdo". </p> <br>
    <p> The "blockquote" tag defines a section that is quoted from another source and are usually indented. Below is an example of such: </p>
    <blockquote cite = "https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/03/01/funimation-content-moving-to-crunchyroll-for-worlds-largest-anime-library"> 
    Huge news: Anime just powered up! Funimation, which serves millions of anime fans in over 52 countries and 10 languages, will be unifying under the Crunchyroll 
      brand. This move will include Funimation’s subsidiary, Wakanim, as well as Crunchyroll’s VRV to create one subscription service for our anime fans worldwide.
    </blockquote> <br>
    <p> The "q" tag defines a quotation by inserting quotation marks where the tags appear. Below is an example of such: (each anime has its own quotation marks) </p>
    <p> That includes titles available now like <q> My Hero Academia </q>, <q> Tokyo Ghoul </q> and <q> Yu Yu Hakusho </q> alongside favorites like <q> Cowboy Bebop 
    </q> and <q> Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation </q>, all under one subscription! </p> <br>
    <p> The "abbr" tag defines abbreviations. (Including the title attribute allows the user to view the full meaning when the mouse hovers over the abbreviation.) 
      Below is an example of such: </p> 
    <p> My favorite anime from Crunchyroll is <abbr title = "One Piece"> OP </abbr>. </p> <br>
    <p> The "address" tag defines the contact information for an author/owner of an article/document. This can include email addresses, URLs, home addresses, phone 
      numbers, social media accounts, etc. <i> *See at the "More About Me" section at the bottom of the HTML page for example* </i> </p> <br>
    <p> The "cite" tag defines the title of a creative work in italic format. Below is an example of such: </p> 
    <p> <cite> One Piece </cite> by Eiichiro Oda. </p> <br>
    <p> The "bdo" tag stands for Bi-Directional Override. It overrides the text direction. Below is an example of such: </p> 
    <bdo dir = "rtl"> One Piece </bdo> <br>

    <h1> COLORS </h1>
    <p> WIP - See in https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp </p> <br>
    
    <h1> CSS </h1>
    <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to format the layout of the HTML webpage. It has 3 ways of being added into HTML pages. This is inline CSS, 
      Internal CSS, and External CSS. </p> <br>
    <p> Inline CSS applies a CSS style to a single HTML element by using the style attribute on an HTML element as shown below <i> in HTML source code </i>. </p>
    <p style = "color: green;"> Inline CSS </p> <br>
    <p> Internal CSS applies a CSS style for the HTML page by defining a style element in the "head" section of the HTML page. <i> See "head" section of HTML source 
      code for example where the background color of the HTML page is changed. </i> </p> <br>
    <p> External CSS can define the CSS styles for multiple HTML pags by creating an external file <i> which can be found in the designated CSS file in this GitHub 
      Repository. External sheets can be referenced through a file name, a full URL, or a relative path. </i> To view the external style sheet reference, <i> see HTML 
      source code in "head" section. </i> </p>
    
    <h1> LINKS </h1>
    <p> HTML allows users to click and jump to different webpages by using hyperlinks. HTML links uses the "a" tag and must have the "href" attribute since it's the 
      link's destination. The content between the "a" starting and ending tags will be the link shown as text that is displayed to the user. It will still function as 
      a hyperlink and send the user to the new URL when clicked. Below is an example: </p> <br>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com"> Click to go to Google </a>
    <br>
    <p> HTML hyperlinks have another important attribute known as the "target" attribute. By default, the "target" attribute will have the "_self" value. However, the 
      user can freely choose from the following values: "_self", "_blank", "_parent", and "_top". </p> <br>
    <p> The "_self" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in the same window/tab. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_self"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> The "_blank" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in a new window/tab. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_blank"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> The "_parent" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in the parent frame. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_parent"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> The "_top" value from the "target" attribute will open the link in a full body of the window. <p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" target = "_top"> Click to go to Google </a> <br>
    <p> HTML links can be specified through an Absolute URL or a Relative URL as shown below <i> in the HTML source code </i>. </p> <br>
    <p> Absolute URL: <a href = "https://www.google.com"> Click to go to Google </a> </p>
    <p> Relative URL: <a href = "google.com"> Click to go to Google </a> </p> <br>
    <p> HTML Links can also be displayed as images while having the full capabilities of hyperlinks by putting the "img" tag in the content section of the "a" tag.</p>
    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target = "_blank">
      <img src = "https://media.musclegrid.io/thekarateedge.com/uploads/2017/05/13234502/click-here-to-enroll.png" width = "300" height = "300">
    </a>
    <br>
    <p> HTML buttons can also be used to access different hyperlinks as shown below. </p>
    <button onclick = "document.location='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'"> Rick Roll Button </button>
    <br>
    <p> Using the title attribute, HTML links can display extra information as a tooltip which is shown when the mouse hovers over the title of the link. </p>
    <a href = "https://www.google.com" title = "Click to search on Google" target = "_blank"> Google </a> <br>
     <!-- Link colors -->
      
    <h1> IMAGES </h1>
    <img src = "https://wallpaper.dog/large/20345592.jpg" alt = "One Piece image" width = "700" height = "700"> </img> <!-- TO be continued -->
  <br>
  
  <h1> FAVICONS </h1>
  <p> A favicon is the small image displayed next to the webpage title in the browser tab. <i> To see how the favicon is implemented into the site, view the HTML 
    source code under the head section below the title line. </i> </p>
    
  <h1> TABLES </h1> 
  <p> HTML tables arranges datas into rows and columns. </p> <!-- To be continued -->
  
  <h1> LISTS </h1> 
  <p> HTML lists groups a set of items or data into ordered and/or unordered lists. </p> <!-- To be continued. -->
  
  <h1> BLOCK AND INLINE </h1>
  <p> Every HTML element has a display value. However, in HTML, there are two types of display values. These two types are block and inline. <br> Block-level elements 
    are elements that alawys start on new lines along with the browser adding a margin before and after the element. Block-level elements typically takes up the full 
    width of the display. The most commonly used block elements are the "p" and "div" tags. Other block elements are the "address", "article", "aside", "blockquote", 
    "canvas", "dd", "div", "dl", "dt", "fieldset", "figcaption", "figure", "footer", "form", "h1-h6", "header", "hr", "li", "main", "nav", "noscript", "ol", "p", 
    "pre", "section", "table", "tfoot", "ul", and "video" tags. <br> Inline elements are elements that doesn't start on a new line. Unlike block elements, inline 
    elements will only take as much width as it needs. Inline elements in HTML are the "a", "abbr", "acronym", "b", "bdo", "big", "br", "button", "cite", "code", 
    "dfn", "em", "i", "img", "input", "kbd", "label", "map", "object", "output", "q", "samp", "script", "select", "small", "span", "strong", "sub", "sup", "textarea", 
    "time", "tt", and "var" tags. <br> The "div" element is used in HTML as a container to divide different HTML elements. Attributes aren't required, although, its 
    most common attributes are "id", "class", and "style". Below is an example of the "style" attribute used on a "div" element. </p> <br> 
    <div style = "background-color: red; color: gold;">
      <h4> I am Iron Man! </h4>
  </div> <br>
  <p> The "span" element is an inline element used to mark up part of a text/document. Similarly to the "div" element, "span" uses the common attributes "id", "class" 
    and "style" attributes although they are not required. Below is an example of the "style" attribute used on a "span" element. </p> <br>
  <p> My favorite <span style = "background-color: red; color: blue;"> Spider Man </span> is Tobey Maguire. </p>
  <br>
  
  <h1> CLASSES </h1>
  <p> The HTML "class" attribute specifies a class for an HMTL element. With the "class" attribute, multiple HTML elements can share the same class. This can also be 
    used in CSS stylesheets and Javascript scripts to access and manipulate elements within the class. To create a class, the syntax starts with a period (.) followed 
    by the class name and curly braces where in between is the properties for the class. The user can have multiple classes for each HTML element and different 
    elements can even share the same class. Note: the class name is case sensitive. In this example, the class will be declared in the head section (found in the HTML 
    source code) and below, the class will be called with the div and span elements below and if done correctly, the example paragraphs will be in the Times New Roman 
    font with a white text color. </p> <br>
    
    <div class = "main">
      <p> Hello World! </p>
  </div>
  <p> Hello <span class = "main"> Beautiful </span> World! </p>
  <br>
  
  <h1> IDS </h1>
  <p> The HTML "id" attribute allows the user to specify a unique id for HTML elements. Multiple elements can't have the same id unlike HTML classes. The value of the 
    id attribute must be unique within the HTML page. Just like HTML classes, the "id" attribute can be used in CSS stylesheets and Javascript scripts and the syntax 
    are the same, but instead the "id" attribute uses a hashtag character (#) instead of the period character that the classes use when declaring them. "Ids" are also 
    case sensitive and must have at least one character, can't have spaces, and can't start with a number. In this example, the id will be declared in the head section
    (HTML source code) and below, the heading will have its font changed to the copperplate font. </p> <br>
    
  <h3 id = "uni"> Hello World! </h3>
  <br>
  
  <p> Thanks to the "id" attribute, they can serve as bookmarks which can be used to jump from one section of the webpage to another section. This is done by creating 
    an id and then adding a link to the id. When the link is clicked, the page will automatically scroll to the bookmarked link. </p>
  <!-- Create sections at top of page where user can use to scroll to different parts of HTML page; use this example to put user back to top of page. -->
  
  <h1> IFRAMES </h1>
  <p> An HTML IFRAME is a web page displayed in a web page. This is done by using the "iframe" tag to specify an inline frame. The inline frame allows the HTML page to
    embed another document with the HTML document. Below is the iframe displaying one of my go to anime websites. <br> </p>
    
  <iframe src = "https://www2.kickassanime.ro/" title = "Anime Streaming Site" height = "400" width = "600"> </iframe>
  
  <p> It is encouraged to add a title attribute to the iframe syntax so the user can read what the content of Iframe is about. The height and width attribute may also 
    be used to specify the size of the frame in pixels. The style attribute can also be used to adjust the height and width properties through the CSS format. Below is
    another example of another anime streaming website, but if you look closely, the border in the Iframe is no longer there. <br> </p>
  
  <iframe src = "https://animedao.to/animelist/popular" title = "Anime Streaming Site 2" style = "height:400px;width:600px;border:none;"> </iframe>
  
  <p> There is a border that surrounds the Iframe by default, but it can be removed or changed by using the style attribute using the CSS border property. Below is the
  same Example 2, but this time, it will have a yellow border surrounding the Iframe. </p>
  
  <iframe src = "https://animedao.to/animelist/popular" title = "Anime Streaming Site 2" style = "height:400px;width:600px;border:2px solid yellow;"> </iframe>
  
  <p> Lastly, the target attribute of the url in the Iframe can be used as a target frame for a link. Below is an example of this situation. The iframe will start on 
    the AnimeDao website, but once the link below is clicked, it will open the episode list of One Piece. </p> <br>
  
  <iframe src = "https://animedao.to/animelist/popular" name = "switch" title = "Anime Website"> </iframe>
  <a href = "https://animedao.to/anime/onepiece/" target = "switch"> One Piece </a>
  
  <h1> JAVASCRIPT </h1>
  <p> This will be a simple introduction of JavaScript. To learn more about Javascript, a Javascript file will be created and asscessible for the user to view at a
    later time. <i> Javascript scripts will be located at the bottom of the HTML source code below the body section. </i> This first example is a button and when 
  clicked, it will display the time and date. </p> 
  
  <button type = "button" onclick = "js"> Click for the current Date and Time </button>
