    <p> Summary of HTML: HTML is the standard markup page for the creation of Web pages. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of a Web page 
    and consists of a series of elements. Overall, HTML tells the browser how to display the content on the web page. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1> ELEMENTS </h1>
    <p> HTML elements are the contents stored inside the start and end tags. Note: there are some elements that don't require end tags (like "br"), which are also known as empty
      elements. All HTML pages should be nested HTML elements, which is when elements contain other elements. For example, the "html" tag must contain "head" and "body" starting
      and ending tags inside the "html" tag. <br> Some HTML tags don't require an ending tag, but it is always recommended to include them to avoid errors and bugs. HTML is not 
      case sensitive, but it is recommended to use lowercases, at least when it comes to using tags. </p>
